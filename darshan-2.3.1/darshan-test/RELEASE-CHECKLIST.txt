Notes on how to release a new version of Darshan
2013-05
-----------------------

- check Darshan trac to see if there are any pending tickets for this
  release/milestone if applicable
  http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/darshan/roadmap
- check for any problems in jenkins nightly builds
- make sure that documentation in darshan-util/doc/ and darshan-runtime/doc/
  are up to date
- update the Changelog if needed (browse git log since last release)
  - commit
- update version number in configure.in (see AC_INIT)
  - in both darshan-util/ and darshan-runtime/
  - re-run ./prepare in both darshan-util and darshan-runtime
  - commit
- generate example output files on x86_64, ppc32, and ppc64, commit in
  darshan-test/example-output/ directory
- use "git status" to make sure that all changes have been committed and
  pushed to origin/master
- make a tag for the release according to instructions at
  http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging
  - example (annotated tag, pushed to repo):
    git tag -a darshan-2.3.1-pre2 -m 'Darshan 2.3.1-pre2'
    git push origin darshan-2.3.1-pre2
- TESTING
  - manually trigger jenkins test
  - run regression tests on BG platform (see
    darshan-test/regression/README.BG.txt)
- export the tag and tar gzip it
  - easiest method is to do a fresh checkout and remove the .git
    subdirectory
  - upload .tar.gz file to /mcs/ftp/pub/darshan/releases
- generate web documentation from asciidoc by running make in
  darshan-util/doc/ and darshan-runtime/doc/ directories
  - upload .html files to /mcs/web/research/projects/darshan/docs
- update download page on darshan web site: www.mcs.anl.gov/darshan/download
- announce on web page (new post) and mailing list

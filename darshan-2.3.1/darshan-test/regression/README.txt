This directory contains regression tests for both the runtime and util
components of Darshan, assuming that Darshan is already compiled and
installed in a known path.

The master script must be executed with three arguments:

1) path to darshan installation
2) path to temporary directory (for building executables, collecting logs, 
   etc. during test)
3) platform type; options include:
   - ws (for a standard workstation)

The platform type should map to a subdirectory containing scripts
that describe how to perform platform-specific tasks (like loading or
generating darshan wrappers and executing jobs).
